*"Go read the docs"*

... but sometimes the docs are too difficult/intimadating to understand, especially for those who just started in web development.

This is a curated list of helpful articles, videos, tips and other resources on web development/design found on [The Internets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internets). 

This is not a list of available frameworks, libraries, and other shinies of different tools and languages. Take a look at the [awesome lists](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) for that. This list focuses on resources detailing how to use the tools. 

Any contributions are welcome.
Please look at the raw README file for the overall structure of the list.
Description for each item is recommended but not required.
