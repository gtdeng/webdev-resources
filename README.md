*"Go read the docs"*

... but sometimes the docs are too difficult/intimadating to understand, especially for those who just started in web development.

This is a curated list of helpful articles, videos, tips and other resources on web development/design found on [The Internets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internets). 

This is not a list of available frameworks, libraries, and other shinies of different tools and languages. Take a look at the multiple [awesome lists](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) for that. This list focuses on resources detailing how to use the tools. 

Any contributions are welcome.  
- Description for each item is recommended but not required.
- Please look at the raw README file for the overall structure of the list.
- More specific Contribution Guidelines to come.
